# Sample MQTT

Playing with publish/subscribe paradigm

## Dependencies

- nodejs
- npm
- command line (bash)
- [mqtt.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js)
- [mqtt-server](https://github.com/mqttjs/mqtt-server)

## How to run this

Enter both folders (client and server) and

I might drop the mqtt-server over this one.
